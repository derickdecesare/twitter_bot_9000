The ability to distinguish between diverse concepts,\\nidentify fairness and injustice, and comprehend a range of legal notions\\nfundamentally relies on logical reasoning. Large Language Models (LLMs) attempt\\nto emulate human language understanding and generation, but their competency in\\nlogical reasoning remains limited. This paper seeks to address the\\nphilosophical question: How can we effectively teach logical reasoning to LLMs\\nwhile maintaining a deep understanding of the intricate relationship between\\nlanguage and logic? By focusing on bolstering LLMs' capabilities in logical\\nreasoning, we aim to expand their applicability in law and other\\nlogic-intensive disciplines. To this end, we propose a Reinforcement Learning\\nfrom Logical Feedback (RLLF) approach, which serves as a potential framework\\nfor refining LLMs' reasoning capacities. Through RLLF and a revised evaluation\\nmethodology, we explore new avenues for research in this domain and contribute\\nto the development of LLMs capable of handling complex legal reasoning tasks\\nwhile acknowledging the fundamental connection between language and logic.\\n\\nTitle: Influencing Reinforcement Learning through Natural Language Guidance\\nArXiv ID: 2104.01506v2\\nSummary: Interactive reinforcement learning agents use human feedback or instruction\\nto help them learn in complex environments. Often, this feedback comes in the\\nform of a discrete signal that is either positive or negative. While\\ninformative, this information can be difficult to generalize on its own. In\\nthis work, we explore how natural language advice can be used to provide a\\nricher feedback signal to a reinforcement learning agent by extending policy\\nshaping, a well-known Interactive reinforcement learning technique. Usually\\npolicy shaping employs a human feedback policy to help an agent to learn more\\nabout how to achieve its goal. In our case, we replace this human feedback\\npolicy with policy generated based on natural language advice. We aim to\\ninspect if the generated natural language reasoning provides support to a deep\\nreinforcement learning agent to decide its actions successfully in any given\\nenvironment. So, we design our model with three networks: first one is the\\nexperience driven, next is the advice generator and third one is the advice\\ndriven. While the experience driven reinforcement learning agent chooses its\\nactions being influenced by the environmental reward, the advice driven neural\\nnetwork with generated feedback by the advice generator for any new state\\nselects its actions to assist the reinforcement learning agent to better policy\\nshaping.\\n\\nTitle: Weakly Supervised Reasoning by Neuro-Symbolic Approaches\\nArXiv ID: 2309.13072v1\\nSummary: Deep learning has largely improved the performance of various natural\\nlanguage processing (NLP) tasks. However, most deep learning models are\\nblack-box machinery, and lack explicit interpretation. In this chapter, we will\\nintroduce our recent progress on neuro-symbolic approaches to NLP, which\\ncombines different schools of AI, namely, symbolism and connectionism.\\nGenerally, we will design a neural system with symbolic latent structures for\\nan NLP task, and apply reinforcement learning or its relaxation to perform\\nweakly supervised reasoning in the downstream task. Our framework has been\\nsuccessfully applied to various tasks, including table query reasoning,\\nsyntactic structure reasoning, information extraction reasoning, and rule\\nreasoning. For each application, we will introduce the background, our\\napproach, and experimental results.\\n\", name='search_arxiv', tool_call_id='toolu_01MLHT5MkxocMxGEbBcTnbom')]</pre>"

      "Summary:\n",
      "The paper \"Enhancing Logical Reasoning in Large Language Models to Facilitate Legal Applications\" addresses the limitations of Large Language Models (LLMs) in logical reasoning, particularly in the legal domain. The authors propose a novel approach called Reinforcement Learning from Logical Feedback (RLLF) to improve LLMs' logical reasoning capabilities while minimizing human biases. This approach combines both human feedback and logical feedback to train the reward predictor, aiming to enhance LLMs' performance in complex legal reasoning tasks. The paper also explores various logical representations for feedback and discusses their potential impact on capturing LLMs' logical reasoning abilities.\n",
